# Overview

Tauri desktop note-taking app (`apps/desktop/`) with a web app (`apps/web/`).
Uses pnpm workspaces.
SQLite is the primary data store (schema and migrations in `crates/db-app/`, desktop transport in `plugins/db/`), Zustand is used for UI state, and ProseMirror powers the editor (`packages/editor`, via `@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror`); documents are stored as TipTap-dialect ProseMirror JSON (converters/validation in `crates/tiptap`). Sessions are the core entity — all notes are backed by sessions.

## Commands

- Format: `pnpm exec dprint fmt`
- Typecheck (TS): `pnpm -r typecheck`
- Typecheck (Rust): `cargo check`
- Desktop dev: `turbo dev:desktop`
- Web dev: `turbo dev:web`
- Dev docs: https://docs.anarlog.so

## Pre-commit verification

- Before every commit, run the locally available checks from the CI workflows affected by the changed paths. Do not defer routine validation to CI.
- Always run `pnpm exec dprint fmt`, then `pnpm fmt:check`.
- For TypeScript changes, run the affected package's typecheck and tests. For desktop changes, run `pnpm -F desktop typecheck` and `pnpm -F desktop test`; use `pnpm -r typecheck` when changes span packages.
- For desktop TypeScript changes, run the CI lint command: `pnpm exec oxlint --quiet --format=github apps/desktop/src/`.
- When desktop translated copy, message extraction, or catalogs may change, run `pnpm -F desktop exec lingui extract --clean --workers 1` and `pnpm -F desktop exec lingui compile --strict --workers 1`, include all generated `apps/desktop/src/i18n/locales` changes, and rerun until generation is stable. When there is no intentional uncommitted catalog diff, run the exact CI check: `pnpm -F desktop i18n:check`.
- For Rust changes, run `cargo check` and the affected package tests. Match stricter workflow commands such as `cargo clippy --locked ... -D warnings` when the changed paths trigger them.
- Check the relevant `.github/workflows/*_ci.*`, `fmt.yaml`, and `lint.yaml` files for package-specific tests, generated-file checks, or build validation, and run the locally reproducible commands before committing.
- If a required check fails, fix it before committing. If a check cannot run locally because of platform, secrets, or unavailable infrastructure, report the exact skipped command and reason; do not claim full validation.

## Guidelines

- JavaScript/TypeScript formatting runs through `oxfmt` via dprint's exec plugin.
- Use `useForm` (tanstack-form) and `useQuery`/`useMutation` (tanstack-query) for form/mutation state. Avoid manual state management (e.g. `setError`).
- For `plugins/db` live queries, keep schema creation, migrations, and DB initialization on the Rust side; TypeScript should only consume `execute`/`subscribe` APIs.
- New SQLite migrations must be downgrade-safe (older builds tolerate newer schemas): additive only, new columns nullable or with a DEFAULT. If a migration can't be downgrade-safe, add a `-- breaking` line to the leading comment block of its `.sql` file so older builds refuse the database with an update prompt.
- Branch naming: `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/` prefixes.

## Code Style

- Avoid creating types/interfaces unless shared. Inline function props.
- Do not write comments unless code is non-obvious. Comments should explain "why", not "what".
- Use `cn` from `@anlg/utils` for conditional classNames. Always pass an array, split by logical grouping.
- Use `motion/react` instead of `framer-motion`.
- Prefer DOM order for local overlap and portals for cross-tree floating UI. Use `z-index` only inside a bounded stacking context with explicit sibling ordering; do not add arbitrary global or escalating values.

## CLI TUI Command Architecture

Choose the lightest command structure that fits the workflow.

Use the full reducer/effect/runtime split only when the command has async orchestration, a multi-step workflow, or substantial state transitions that benefit from reducer-style tests.

```
commands/<name>/
  mod.rs        -- Screen impl, Args, run()          [glue]
  app.rs        -- App or screen-local state          [optional]
  action.rs     -- Action enum                        [optional]
  effect.rs     -- Effect enum                        [optional]
  runtime.rs    -- Runtime, RuntimeEvent              [async I/O]
  ui.rs         -- draw(frame, app)                   [rendering]
```

Naming rules:

- Types drop the command prefix: `App`, `Action`, `Effect`, `Runtime`, `RuntimeEvent`
- `app.rs` → `app/mod.rs` with private submodules when state is complex
- `ui.rs` → `ui/mod.rs` with sub-files when rendering is complex
- `action.rs`/`effect.rs` are siblings of `mod.rs` when they exist; do not create them by default for simple list/detail screens
- `app.rs` contains no rendering logic, no API calls, no async code when using the reducer pattern
- Prefer `screen.rs` plus a small local state struct for simple browse/select flows
- Do not add parent-level action/effect translation layers that proxy child workflows through another command's reducer

## Misc

- Do not create summary docs or example code files unless requested.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Environment is Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64. Node 22, pnpm 11.1.1, and Rust 1.94.0 are pre-provisioned, and the Linux system libraries needed for the Tauri desktop build (from `scripts/setup-linux-tauri.sh` + `scripts/setup-linux-others.sh`: webkit2gtk-4.1, gtk-3/4, alsa, pulse, pipewire, clang/libclang, cmake, patchelf, etc.) plus `xvfb`/`dbus-x11` are baked into the base image. The startup update script only runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and builds `@anlg/ui`; it does not re-install system packages.

- Prefer `turbo dev:desktop` / `turbo dev:web` over the raw `pnpm dev:*` scripts: turbo builds `@anlg/ui` first via its `dependsOn`, so you never have to remember the separate `pnpm -F @anlg/ui build` step (raw `pnpm dev:*` does not).
- No `start`/`terminals` are configured in the environment (only the `install`/update script). Dev servers are started on demand, not auto-launched on boot.
- A real XFCE desktop runs on the VNC display `:1` (this is what computer-use sees). Run the desktop app there instead of `xvfb` so it is visible: `DISPLAY=:1 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 GALLIUM_DRIVER=llvmpipe WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 turbo dev:desktop`. First `tauri dev` compiles the whole Rust workspace (~2000 crates) and is slow; the desktop Vite frontend serves on `:1422`.
- Both apps are local-first and boot without secrets: `dotenvx` loads `.env.supabase`/`.env` with `--ignore MISSING_ENV_FILE`. Cloud/Pro features (auth, CloudSync, hosted STT/LLM, web billing) need local Supabase (`task supabase-start`, requires Docker) and `cargo run -p api`. LLM/STT provider keys are entered in-app.
- Web dev: `turbo dev:web` serves on `:3000` and renders without Supabase; only auth/DB-backed routes require the Supabase stack.
- `pnpm fmt:check` (`dprint check`) reports ~67 failures on Linux, all Swift files ("Cannot start formatter process") because `dprint` shells out to `swift format`, which is macOS-only. These are not real diffs; non-Swift formatting still validates. Scope fmt checks to changed non-Swift files on Linux.
- No audio input device exists in the headless pod; use `crates/audio-mock` for recording flows. `apps/mobile` (Expo) and `apps/cli-ui` (Swift) cannot be built/run on Linux.
- The default `cc`/`c++` are clang (not gcc). The desktop build compiles a C++ dependency (`knf-rs-sys` from pyannote-rs) via cmake, and clang selects the newest GCC install dir for `libstdc++`, so `libstdc++-14-dev` must be present (it is in the base image). Data path is verified: creating a note writes to `sessions`/`session_documents` (ProseMirror JSON) in the SQLite DB at `~/.local/share/com.hyprnote.dev/app.db`.
- Changelog, release, and QA skills are exposed to Cursor Cloud via `.cursor/skills/` shims (`new-changelog`, `release-new-version`, `qa-critical-ux`, `qa-cli-mcp-api`). Canonical copies live in `.agents/skills/`; edit those only. `qa-critical-ux` is macOS-native and is not a cloud-environment gate.
