# Setup

## MCP

Run the local stdio server with:

```bash
anarlog mcp
```

A generic client configuration is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anarlog": {
      "command": "anarlog",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client after changing its MCP configuration.

## CLI

On macOS, open **Mentari → Settings → Developers** and select **Install**. Mentari installs the bundled command at `~/.local/bin/anarlog`.

To build from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/anarlog.git
cd anarlog
cargo install --locked --path apps/cli
anarlog --version
```

Run the Mentari desktop app once so its local database exists. The CLI and local MCP server work while the app is closed after that.

Cloud sign-in does not require a graphical session on the Mentari machine. Run `anarlog auth login`, open the printed URL in any browser, and paste the copied callback URL into the CLI prompt. Confirm the session with `anarlog auth status`.

The Linux desktop package names the bundled command `anarlog-cli`, so use `anarlog-cli auth login` and `anarlog-cli auth status` there.

Homebrew, standalone release binaries, Windows package-manager distribution, and bundled CLI installation on platforms other than macOS are not yet available.

Use `--db-path FILE` or `ANARLOG_DB_PATH` only when the database is outside Mentari's default application-data location.
