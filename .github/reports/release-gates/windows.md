# Windows release gate

This is the canonical manual QA checklist for
[ANLG-130](https://linear.app/fastrepl-inc/issue/ANLG-130/create-windows-manual-qa-matrix-and-release-gate).
It gates the first Windows release tracked by
[ANLG-68](https://linear.app/fastrepl-inc/issue/ANLG-68/ship-windows-desktop-capture-notifications-and-overlay-support).

Use the exact candidate artifact in every required run. Version 1.4.0 is a VM-first
Windows beta: its explicitly listed VM scope may ship while physical-hardware and AEC
rows remain DEFERRED. VM evidence proves guest endpoint capture only; it does not prove
AEC, real-device routing, hot-plug, suspend/resume, or mixed-DPI behavior.

## Status values

Use one of these values in every result cell:

- PASS: the stated pass criteria were observed and evidence is linked.
- FAIL: the behavior was exercised and did not meet the pass criteria.
- BLOCKED: the test could not start because a prerequisite is missing or broken.
- NOT RUN: the test has not been attempted for this candidate.
- DEFERRED: product scope explicitly excludes the behavior from this release. It is not
  PASS and must name the waiver.
- NOT SUPPORTED: the release explicitly does not support this platform or architecture.

Do not use PASS for a code review, successful compilation, or a result inherited from a
different artifact hash.

## Release coverage

### Architecture and hardware

| Cell ID            | Environment                                       | Release role                                                                         | Required for the first release | Current status | Evidence              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| W-ENV-X64-AMD      | Physical Windows 11 x64 on AMD                    | Primary real-hardware release gate                                                   | Yes                            | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-ENV-X64-INTEL    | Physical Windows 11 x64 on Intel                  | Additional x64 confidence; status must be explicit                                   | No independent block           | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-ENV-X64-CLEAN    | Clean Windows 11 x64 local machine or local VM    | Installer, core app, guest audio, credentials, CloudSync, updater, and uninstall     | Yes                            | NOT RUN        | TBD                   |
| W-ENV-ARM-EMU      | Windows 11 ARM running the published x64 artifact | Optional x64-emulation install, launch, auth, SQLite, CloudSync, and recording smoke | No                             | NOT RUN        | TBD                   |
| W-ENV-ARM-PHYSICAL | Physical Windows ARM                              | Community confidence only                                                            | No                             | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-ENV-ARM64-NATIVE | Native Windows ARM64 artifact                     | Not supported until a native CloudSync DLL and release artifact exist                | No                             | NOT SUPPORTED  | TBD                   |

AMD and Intel are both Windows x64. A passing AMD run is the initial physical x64 gate;
Intel remains a recorded confidence cell, not a separate architecture. Native ARM64 is a
different target. The repository currently bundles CloudSync only for
windows/x86_64.

### Audio and meeting applications

The required rows provide pairwise coverage without requiring every device to be tested
against every meeting application. Run the device-change and lifecycle tests with the
same devices after these rows pass.

| Test ID  | Input                     | Output                     | Application              | Required      | Current status | Evidence              |
| -------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| W-AUD-01 | Built-in microphone       | Built-in speakers          | Zoom                     | Yes           | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-AUD-02 | Bluetooth headset         | Bluetooth headset          | Google Meet in a browser | Yes           | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-AUD-03 | USB microphone            | Wired or USB headphones    | Slack huddle or call     | Yes           | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-AUD-04 | Any already-passing input | Any already-passing output | Microsoft Teams          | No            | NOT RUN        | TBD                   |
| W-AUD-11 | Guest or redirected mic   | Guest default output       | Browser fixture playback | Yes, VM smoke | NOT RUN        | TBD                   |

If the machine has no built-in audio, record the OEM configuration and substitute a
second independent USB or wired device. Do not silently drop a required device class.

### Displays

| Test ID  | Display configuration                         | Required    | Current status | Evidence              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| W-DSP-01 | Single display                                | Yes         | NOT RUN        | TBD                   |
| W-DSP-02 | Internal plus external display                | Yes         | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |
| W-DSP-03 | Mixed-DPI displays, when hardware supports it | Conditional | DEFERRED       | 1.4.0 VM-first waiver |

If mixed-DPI hardware is unavailable, mark W-DSP-03 DEFERRED, record the gap in the
release notes, and do not claim mixed-DPI overlay support.

## 1.4.0 VM-first scope

For this candidate only, the following tests are required for **VM-FIRST BETA SHIP**:
W-ENV-X64-CLEAN; W-DSP-01; W-ART-01 through W-ART-03; W-INS-01 and W-INS-02;
W-UPD-01 and W-UPD-02; W-UNINS-01; W-CORE-01 and W-CORE-02; W-CRED-01 and
W-CRED-02; W-SYNC-01 and W-SYNC-02; W-AUD-05, W-AUD-06, W-AUD-09, and W-AUD-11;
W-NOT-01; W-PERM-01; and W-DESK-01.

W-ENV-X64-AMD, W-ENV-X64-INTEL, W-ENV-ARM-PHYSICAL, W-AUD-01 through W-AUD-03,
W-AUD-07, W-AUD-08, W-AUD-10, W-AEC-01, W-DSP-02, and W-DSP-03 remain explicitly
DEFERRED for physical validation. W-NOT-02, W-OVR-01 through W-OVR-03, W-DET-01, and
W-DET-02 are DEFERRED while their controls are hidden in 1.4.0. Optional and unsupported
rows keep their existing scope.

## Required test checklist

### Artifact, install, update, and removal

| Test ID    | Required | Procedure                                                                                             | Pass criteria                                                                                                                              | Result and evidence |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| W-ART-01   | Yes      | Record the candidate URL, filename, version, commit, size, and SHA-256.                               | The hash matches the published checksum and every required run uses that exact hash.                                                       | NOT RUN             |
| W-ART-02   | Yes      | Inspect the executable and installer Authenticode signatures.                                         | Signature status is valid, the publisher is Fastrepl's approved publisher, and timestamp verification succeeds.                            | NOT RUN             |
| W-ART-03   | Yes      | Confirm the Tauri updater signature is published separately from the Authenticode signature.          | The updater artifact and its .sig file are present and tied to the candidate version.                                                      | NOT RUN             |
| W-INS-01   | Yes      | Install on W-ENV-X64-CLEAN from a fresh download. Record every SmartScreen and UAC screen.            | Publisher identity is correct, any reputation warning is documented verbatim, installation completes, and the app launches.                | NOT RUN             |
| W-INS-02   | Yes      | Check install location, Start menu entry, app icon, protocol registration, and single-instance focus. | Entries use the Mentari identity; mentari:// and legacy anarlog:// and hyprnote:// open the installed app; a second launch focuses the existing instance. | NOT RUN             |
| W-UPD-01   | Yes      | Install the previous supported version, create local data, then update to the candidate.              | Update detection, download, signature verification, install, restart, version change, and existing data all succeed.                       | NOT RUN             |
| W-UPD-02   | Yes      | Interrupt or reject one update attempt, then retry normally.                                          | The installed version remains launchable after the rejected attempt and a later retry succeeds without data loss.                          | NOT RUN             |
| W-UNINS-01 | Yes      | Uninstall from Windows Settings, then reinstall the same candidate.                                   | Executables and shortcuts are removed; user data is neither unexpectedly deleted nor duplicated; reinstall opens the expected local data.  | NOT RUN             |

### Core application, credentials, and sync

| Test ID   | Required | Procedure                                                                                                       | Pass criteria                                                                                                                              | Result and evidence |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| W-CORE-01 | Yes      | Launch, sign in, reach the main shell, open settings, create a session, edit its title and notes, then restart. | No platform-only crash occurs; the session and edits remain present after restart.                                                         | NOT RUN             |
| W-CORE-02 | Yes      | Lock and unlock Windows, minimize and restore the app, then reboot and launch from the Start menu.              | Main-window state is usable after each transition and no duplicate background instance remains.                                            | NOT RUN             |
| W-CRED-01 | Yes      | Sign in, restart twice, and inspect only auth-store file metadata after migration.                              | The session remains usable, current-user DPAPI storage owns auth.dpapi, and no plaintext auth.json fallback remains.                       | NOT RUN             |
| W-CRED-02 | Yes      | Sign out and back in, including one canceled sign-in, then repeat the provider and sync checks.                 | Auth state follows the sign-in lifecycle, durable provider secrets follow declared product policy, and existing secrets are not corrupted. | NOT RUN             |
| W-SYNC-01 | Yes      | Enable CloudSync, create and edit a session, observe it on a second client, restart Windows, and edit again.    | Sync completes in both directions before and after restart without duplicate or missing sessions.                                          | NOT RUN             |
| W-SYNC-02 | Yes      | Start once without network, edit existing local data, restore network, and trigger or wait for sync.            | The app remains usable offline and later syncs without losing the offline edit.                                                            | NOT RUN             |

Do not attach app.db or credential exports as evidence. Record only file metadata and
observable behavior.

### Audio capture

For physical W-AUD-01 through W-AUD-03, play remote speech and speak locally for at
least 30 seconds. For VM W-AUD-11, record 15 seconds of microphone-only input, 15 seconds
of browser playback only, then 30 seconds concurrently. Inspect persisted audio and log
markers; a visual level meter alone is not proof. Host or remote-desktop preprocessing
means W-AUD-11 cannot count as AEC evidence.

| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| W-AUD-01 | Yes            | Run the built-in audio and Zoom matrix row.                                                           | Microphone and WASAPI system audio are both non-silent, concurrent, intelligible, and assigned to the expected channels.                                                                                                           | DEFERRED — 1.4.0 VM-first scope |
| W-AUD-02 | Yes            | Run the Bluetooth and Meet matrix row.                                                                | Both streams remain non-silent and usable with the Bluetooth profile selected by Windows.                                                                                                                                          | DEFERRED — 1.4.0 VM-first scope |
| W-AUD-03 | Yes            | Run the USB microphone and Slack matrix row.                                                          | Both streams remain non-silent and usable without stalls or persistent drift.                                                                                                                                                      | DEFERRED — 1.4.0 VM-first scope |
| W-AUD-05 | Yes            | Start capture before meeting audio, stop, then start capture after meeting audio is already playing.  | Both start orders initialize microphone and WASAPI loopback and produce usable recordings.                                                                                                                                         | NOT RUN                         |
| W-AUD-06 | Yes            | Start and stop ten recordings in succession.                                                          | All ten recordings finalize, no source remains stuck, and the next recording starts normally.                                                                                                                                      | NOT RUN                         |
| W-AUD-07 | Yes            | Change the default input and output while recording, then hot-plug the Bluetooth and USB devices.     | Capture recovers automatically or stops with a visible actionable error; the app can start a new good recording without restart.                                                                                                   | DEFERRED — 1.4.0 VM-first scope |
| W-AUD-08 | Yes            | Suspend and resume Windows during an active recording, then start a new recording.                    | The interrupted recording is not silently presented as complete; the app recovers or reports an actionable error and can record again.                                                                                             | DEFERRED — 1.4.0 VM-first scope |
| W-AUD-09 | Yes            | Record continuously for 60 minutes with microphone and system audio active.                           | Both streams remain present through the end, finalization succeeds, and logs show no sustained queue overflow or capture-thread failure.                                                                                           | NOT RUN                         |
| W-AUD-10 | Yes            | Change Windows sample rate for one endpoint between recordings and repeat a short concurrent capture. | The next recording uses the new configuration or shows a clear unsupported-state error; output remains playable.                                                                                                                   | DEFERRED — 1.4.0 VM-first scope |
| W-AUD-11 | Yes            | Run the microphone-only, playback-only, and concurrent phases in W-ENV-X64-CLEAN.                     | Persisted mic and system tracks are readable and non-silent in the expected phases, both persist concurrently, finalization succeeds, and logs contain no capture failure or sustained queue overflow. This does not evaluate AEC. | NOT RUN                         |
| W-AEC-01 | Physical phase | On physical x64 speakers and microphone, play remote speech while speaking a unique local phrase.     | AEC initializes without failure, remote speech is not duplicated into the mic/transcript, and local speech remains intelligible during double-talk.                                                                                | DEFERRED — physical/AEC phase   |

### Notifications, overlay, detection, and desktop lifecycle

| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| W-NOT-01  | Yes          | Trigger a supported basic notification with Mentari focused, minimized, and backgrounded.                          | Each toast appears once with the correct title, body, icon, and app identity.                                                                                                                                                      | NOT RUN                             |
| W-NOT-02  | Future scope | Repeat one notification with Windows Do Not Disturb or Focus Assist off and on, then clear notifications.          | Suppression behavior follows Windows settings, no silent app error occurs, and clear removes Mentari notifications.                                                                                                                | DEFERRED — controls hidden in 1.4.0 |
| W-OVR-01  | Future scope | Start a recording on a single display; move, interact with, and stop from the floating bar.                        | The bar is visible, always on top without stealing focus, controls emit once, and all overlay state closes after stop.                                                                                                             | DEFERRED — controls hidden in 1.4.0 |
| W-OVR-02  | Future scope | Move the recording window and floating bar between internal and external displays, minimize, restore, and Alt-Tab. | Position, scale, drag behavior, and controls remain usable and the bar does not become stranded off-screen.                                                                                                                        | DEFERRED — controls hidden in 1.4.0 |
| W-OVR-03  | Future scope | Repeat W-OVR-02 across mixed-DPI displays and after changing display scale.                                        | The overlay rescales and remains inside the active display bounds without requiring an app restart.                                                                                                                                | DEFERRED — controls hidden in 1.4.0 |
| W-DET-01  | Future scope | Start and end calls in Zoom, Meet, and Slack; observe meeting detection and microphone-using application state.    | Each supported app is identified without persistent helper-process noise; start/end transitions do not duplicate.                                                                                                                  | DEFERRED — controls hidden in 1.4.0 |
| W-DET-02  | Future scope | Ignore one supported app, restore it, and exercise background and foreground browser tabs.                         | Ignore/include settings change behavior predictably and unsupported detection cases fail quietly with diagnostics.                                                                                                                 | DEFERRED — controls hidden in 1.4.0 |
| W-PERM-01 | Yes          | Review onboarding and settings before and after microphone/system-audio use.                                       | Windows copy describes capability state accurately without a macOS-style prompt; detection, mic auto-stop, floating controls, DND controls, and notification clearing are absent or clearly unavailable rather than silent no-ops. | NOT RUN                             |
| W-DESK-01 | Yes          | Exercise tray show/hide, autostart, global shortcut, deep link, and second-instance activation.                    | Every advertised integration works after restart or is visibly gated before release.                                                                                                                                               | NOT RUN                             |
| W-UIA-01  | No           | If structured Windows UI Automation context is advertised, inspect supported meeting apps and capture evidence.    | Advertised fields are stable and accurate; otherwise the feature is absent from UI and release claims.                                                                                                                             | DEFERRED                            |

W-NOT-02 depends on ANLG-126. W-OVR-01 through W-OVR-03 depend on ANLG-127.
W-DET-01 and W-DET-02 depend on ANLG-128. Their controls, mic-based auto-stop, DND
controls, and notification-history clearing are hidden in 1.4.0; W-PERM-01 fails if any
unsupported control is interactive or silently no-ops. W-UIA-01 belongs to ANLG-129 and
is not a v1 release gate unless the feature is advertised.

## Evidence collection

Create a run ID such as W-RUN-20260717-AMD-01. Attach evidence to ANLG-130 or a
linked issue and put the attachment link in the tables above. Do not commit logs,
screenshots, recordings, database files, or credential exports to this repository.

Before attaching evidence:

- Remove access tokens, email addresses, meeting titles, participant names, and transcript
  content.
- Keep timestamps, device names, driver names, application versions, error messages, and
  the candidate hash.
- Record whether the run was local physical hardware, a local VM, ARM x64 emulation, or
  remote desktop.
- For a VM run, record the hypervisor or remote client, host-to-guest audio redirection,
  selected guest endpoints, and `AEC evaluation: NOT EVALUATED`.

### Environment metadata

Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
$run = "W-RUN-YYYYMMDD-01"
$evidence = Join-Path (Resolve-Path ".") "evidence\$run"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $evidence | Out-Null

Get-ComputerInfo |
  Select-Object WindowsProductName, WindowsVersion, OsBuildNumber,
    CsManufacturer, CsModel, CsSystemType |
  Format-List |
  Out-File (Join-Path $evidence "computer.txt")

Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor |
  Select-Object Name, Manufacturer, Architecture |
  Format-List |
  Out-File (Join-Path $evidence "cpu.txt")

Get-PnpDevice -Class AudioEndpoint |
  Select-Object Status, FriendlyName, InstanceId |
  Format-Table -AutoSize |
  Out-File (Join-Path $evidence "audio-endpoints.txt")

Get-CimInstance Win32_SoundDevice |
  Select-Object Name, Manufacturer, Status, PNPDeviceID |
  Format-List |
  Out-File (Join-Path $evidence "sound-devices.txt")

Get-CimInstance Win32_VideoController |
  Select-Object Name, DriverVersion, CurrentHorizontalResolution,
    CurrentVerticalResolution |
  Format-List |
  Out-File (Join-Path $evidence "display.txt")
```

Record Windows display-scale percentages manually beside display.txt because the WMI
values above do not prove per-display DPI.

### Artifact and signature

```powershell
$artifact = Resolve-Path "PATH_TO_INSTALLER"

Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $artifact |
  Format-List

Get-AuthenticodeSignature $artifact |
  Select-Object Status, StatusMessage, Path,
    @{Name="Subject"; Expression={$_.SignerCertificate.Subject}},
    @{Name="Thumbprint"; Expression={$_.SignerCertificate.Thumbprint}},
    @{Name="TimestampSubject"; Expression={$_.TimeStamperCertificate.Subject}} |
  Format-List

signtool verify /pa /v $artifact
```

Get-AuthenticodeSignature and signtool verify the Windows Authenticode signature.
They do not verify the separate Tauri updater .sig file.

### Application logs and diagnostics

The stable bundle identifier is com.hyprnote.stable. The tracing plugin writes
app.log and up to five rotated files, app.log.1 through app.log.5, under the
Tauri app log directory.

```powershell
$bundleId = "com.hyprnote.stable"
$logDir = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "$bundleId\logs"

Get-ChildItem $logDir -Filter "app.log*" |
  Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime

Get-Content (Join-Path $logDir "app.log") -Tail 500

Select-String -Path (Join-Path $logDir "app.log*") -Pattern "mic_input_initialized|wasapi_loopback_initialized|mic_stream_error|queue_overflow|capture_stream_failed"
```

Use com.hyprnote.staging for a staging package and com.hyprnote.dev for a dev
build. The stable app database normally lives at
$env:APPDATA\anarlog\app.db, but a migrated install can intentionally retain the
legacy hyprnote or bundle-identifier directory.

```powershell
$dbCandidates = @(
  (Join-Path $env:APPDATA "anarlog\app.db"),
  (Join-Path $env:APPDATA "hyprnote\app.db"),
  (Join-Path $env:APPDATA "com.hyprnote.stable\app.db")
)

$dbCandidates |
  Where-Object { Test-Path $_ } |
  ForEach-Object { Get-Item $_ } |
  Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime

Get-ChildItem (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "char\cloudsync") -Recurse -Filter "cloudsync.dll" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime

$authCandidates = @(
  (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "anarlog\auth.dpapi"),
  (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "hyprnote\auth.dpapi"),
  (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "com.hyprnote.stable\auth.dpapi")
)

$authCandidates |
  Where-Object { Test-Path $_ } |
  ForEach-Object { Get-Item $_ } |
  Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime

$plaintextAuthCandidates = @(
  (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "anarlog\auth.json"),
  (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "hyprnote\auth.json"),
  (Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "com.hyprnote.stable\auth.json"),
  (Join-Path $env:APPDATA "anarlog\auth.json"),
  (Join-Path $env:APPDATA "hyprnote\auth.json"),
  (Join-Path $env:APPDATA "com.hyprnote.stable\auth.json")
)

$plaintextAuthCandidates |
  Where-Object { Test-Path $_ }
```

The auth.dpapi listing records only metadata, and the final command must produce no
auth.json paths. Never print the encrypted payload or credential values. The CloudSync
cache path intentionally still uses char/cloudsync.

For an application crash, also collect a bounded Windows event-log slice:

```powershell
$since = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-30)
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName="Application"; StartTime=$since} |
  Where-Object { $_.Message -match "anarlog|hyprnote" } |
  Select-Object TimeCreated, ProviderName, Id, LevelDisplayName, Message |
  Format-List
```

### Optional source-build smoke

These commands are useful before packaging, but they do not replace tests of the signed
candidate artifact:

```powershell
pnpm -F desktop typecheck
cargo check -p desktop --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
turbo dev:desktop
$env:POSTHOG_API_KEY = "phc_local_smoke"
$env:VITE_API_URL = "https://api.anarlog.so"
pnpm -F desktop tauri build --ci --bundles nsis --no-sign --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --config ./src-tauri/tauri.conf.staging.json --features devtools
```

## Ship and no-ship rules

Mark the candidate **VM-FIRST BETA SHIP** only when all of the following are true:

- Every test in the 1.4.0 VM-first scope is PASS for the exact published artifact hash.
- Version and commit exactly match the macOS and Linux 1.4.0 candidate reports.
- Authenticode, updater signatures, published checksums, install, update, and uninstall
  pass.
- W-AUD-11 proves non-silent concurrent guest microphone and WASAPI system audio; it is
  not reported as AEC evidence.
- DPAPI-protected auth persistence, local SQLite durability, CloudSync, basic
  notifications, and W-PERM-01 capability gating pass.
- The download page and release notes label Windows as beta and list the deferred
  physical-device, AEC, suspend/resume, and multi-display coverage.
- Every physical row in the 1.4.0 waiver remains DEFERRED, and no open blocker remains in
  the beta scope.

Mark the candidate **HARDWARE-VALIDATED SHIP** only after VM-FIRST BETA SHIP and all
of the following:

- W-ENV-X64-AMD and the physical W-AUD-01 through W-AUD-03, W-AUD-07, W-AUD-08,
  W-AUD-10, and W-AEC-01 pass.
- Microphone, WASAPI system audio, AEC, device recovery, and double-talk are stable on
  physical x64 hardware.
- The claimed physical display and overlay rows pass.

Mark the candidate NO SHIP when any of these conditions is present:

- The artifact is unsigned, has an invalid signature, has a mismatched checksum, or is not
  the artifact that was tested.
- Install, launch, update, or uninstall can corrupt or unexpectedly remove user data.
- Microphone or system audio is silent, stalls, or fails to finalize in a required
  environment.
- Credentials disappear unexpectedly, are written to plaintext, or CloudSync loses or
  duplicates user data.
- An advertised notification, recording control, meeting-detection path, or overlay
  behavior is absent or silently no-ops.
- A platform capability is advertised even though it is unavailable.

The first Windows release may defer all of the following if the product and release notes
say so explicitly:

- A native Windows ARM64 artifact and native ARM64 CloudSync.
- Physical Windows ARM validation.
- Structured Windows UI Automation meeting context.
- Microsoft Teams-specific confidence coverage.
- Mixed-DPI overlay support when no suitable test hardware is available.
- Optional live-caption or overlay settings beyond the declared W-OVR scope.
- Meeting/app detection, mic-based auto-stop, floating controls, DND controls, and
  notification-history clearing while those controls remain hidden from Windows users.

For the 1.4.0 VM-first beta only, the explicit physical and AEC rows above may be
deferred. It may not defer signed x64 artifacts, clean install/update/uninstall, VM mic
and system-audio capture, durable local data, secure credentials, CloudSync, or desktop
behaviors advertised to Windows beta users.
